										<h2>Tired of taking notes? Why not do something instead.</h2>
									</header>
                  <p>Life is full of distractions. It seems that everyone is always trying to multitask, which has led to a severe lack of ability to focus. In the college environment, this has had a big impact on the effectiveness of lecture-based classes. Students always have their list of assignments buzzing around in their heads, making it difficult to pay attention to the subject at hand. This makes it hard to do well on exams, because lectures are often the students’ only opportunities to take in course information.</p>
                  <h3 id="why-project-based-learning">Why Project-Based Learning?</h3>
                  <p>This is where project-based learning comes in. My major, Computer Science, is widely project-based, and it has made an immense difference in how much I get out of my classes. In my lecture-heavy classes, where I am just given a set of slides to analyze and memorize for an exam, I can get easily bored and lost. In my experience, I learn best by applying knowledge through projects, and engaging in collaborative activities. Project-based learning in a class doesn’t have to mean that lectures are completely done away with. Instead, lectures can be used as informational sessions to provide the required background knowledge to help students succeed on their projects, and supplement their learning. Lectures can also be a time for students to ask clarifying questions to their professor. In this way, lectures become more of a conversation and discussion, rather than a long speech. Students will then spend their time outside of lecture applying the background information toward the project assignment, and discovering a lot of the information on their own. For a more formal definition of Project-Based Learning, you can visit the <a href="https://www.bie.org/about/what_pbl" title="Project-Based Learning link">Project-Based Learning page</a> of the website for the Buck Institute for Education.</p>
                  <p>Project based learning also has the possibility to greatly reduce stress among students. A common cause of stress in school is exams, because even if a student goes in to an exam feeling prepared, after having studied for a week, they could still answer incorrectly on trick questions and receive a low grade. Through tests, especially when they are designed to trick students, the grade a student receives does not necessarily represent their understanding, or the amount of work that was put in. With project based learning, this could be easily resolved. With projects, students are more in control of their grades. If they work hard toward their end result, and put in effort to make their project the best it can be, their grade will reflect that work. Throughout the process of creating a high-quality assignment, they will also internalize the course information, because they will have a more personal connection to it.</p>
                  <p>While cramming for an exam does help me to learn last minute, that knowledge doesn’t really stick. It leaves my memory almost instantly after the exam, because I learned it through rote memorization, and never have a reason to use that knowledge again. This is what makes project-based learning so amazing. Instead of sitting in class and listening to a professor saying “You need to know this fact because it will be on the exam”, students will discover for themselves what information is necessary to complete a project, and therefore learn the course curriculum. This expands a students’ knowledge on their own terms, while improving research skills and self confidence. If project assignments are written well enough, they can be designed to lead a student to discover major parts of a curriculum on their own, with minimal guidance other than the lecture-based background information. After finishing a class project, students will feel accomplished and proud of their work, and will be more likely to recall the material, since they discovered it for themselves.</p>

                  <p>My best examples of how project-based learning has impacted my education are from my entry level Computer Science courses. I came into college having never programmed before, so just listening about the concepts in class was never enough to get me to understand what was going on. I would often leave lectures lost and confused, except for the times when my professor did coding demonstrations for the class. Luckily, my introductory Computer Science courses involved two parts: lecture and lab. They were laid out as:</p>
                  <p><strong>Lecture:</strong> - One hour long lectures with one professor, and about 200 students (twice a week) - Exams testing on lecture and project content - Projects based on skills learned in lecture and lab</p>
                  <p><strong>Lab:</strong> - Two hour long meetings with two teaching assistants, and about 25 students (once a week) - Small projects to be completed during that time, which helped to solidify what was learned during lectures - The teaching assistants were available to help answer questions about the small lab assignments and the large projects (functioned kind of like a mandatory office hours)</p>
                  <p>I found the lab portions of my introductory classes extremely helpful, because they guided me through the steps of various small programming assignments, which were each designed to help teach the basic concepts of programming, and reinforce what we had learned in class. The teaching assistants were available to help students work through points of confusion, and were constantly encouraging and helpful whenever I struggled with a project.</p>
                  <p>Schools have been making positive strides toward more applicable assignments with initiatives such as One-To-The-World in Loudoun County Public Schools in northern Virginia, where students have to have one project in each class that makes an impact on the surrounding community. I am very excited to see the direction that project-based learning is going in, and I hope to see many K-12 and higher education institutions adopt this teaching style, instead of determining a student’s grades almost solely based off of tests. If you are an educator, consider adding at least one or two projects a year into your curriculum. If you are a student, seek out teachers or professors who are known for hands on work, so that you can get the engaging, in-depth education you deserve.</p>
