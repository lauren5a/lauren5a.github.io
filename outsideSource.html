										<h2>The Danger of a Single Story: A Ted Talk by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</h2>
									</header>
                  <p>Ever since I was introduced to this Ted Talk in school, I have loved the message, and it is one of my favorite videos.  This video especially ties into my group's video assignment about international students, but focuses more on international student experiences once they have reached the United States.  The danger of a single story is a big issue for international students in the American education system, because American students often have no exposure to other countries, and therefore may be quick to judge or make generalizations about these students based on their single story.  This is why it is important to educate American students to make them more culturally aware, which can be done through international exchange or foreign language programs in k-12 education.
