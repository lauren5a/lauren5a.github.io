										<h2>Je veux parle beaucoup des langues:<br>If you can’t understand this, that’s exactly why you need to read it.</h2>
									</header>
                  <p>Imagine yourself walking down the streets of a town you have dreamed of visiting for a lifetime. Think about the excitement coursing through your veins and the anticipation for the days to come. Now take a moment to soak in your excitement, until you realize something isn't quite right. You look around, and you can’t read any of the words you see on storefronts and roadsigns. Someone speaks to you and you can’t process it. After a few disorienting minutes, you finally realize the problem: You didn’t pay attention in your high school foreign language class.</p>
                  <p>Foreign language classes exist to promote bilingualism, which has numerous benefits, both to cultural understanding, and personal health. Knowing multiple languages helps one’s interpersonal skills expand across cultures, because people are often much more comfortable when spoken to in their native language. It also comes across as courteous to speak with someone in their own native language, instead of expecting them to understand yours. Bilingualism has health benefits, because it is known to be a wonderful way to exercise the brain. Learning a secondary language has been shown to decrease the effects of memory loss and deteriorating mental function as we age. Unfortunately, regardless of the immense benefits of bilingualism, it still isn’t taken very seriously during early education.</p>
                  <p><strong>This problem has some simple solutions:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Encourage students to download language learning apps such as <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> to use in their free time</li>
                  <li>Provide Bilingual Education throughout the K-12 curriculum</li>
                  <li>Implement international pen-pal programs in schools</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3 id="language-learning-with-age">Language Learning with Age</h3>
                  <p>If you are like me, have finished K-12 education, and are sad about missing out on the chance to become bilingual or multilingual, there is still hope! Language learning apps such as <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> can help you learn the basics of a wide variety of languages. This basic knowledge can help you gain confidence to begin more advanced practice such as listening to music, watching movies in that language, or even having conversations with native speakers. While it is harder to acquire language skills as you get older, with dedication, you can still achieve your language goals!</p>
                  <p><strong>Young children have it much easier.</strong> Simply speak to them in a foreign language, and they will pick up words easily, not much differently than how they learn their native language. Because of young childrens' ease of language learning, I believe raising children monolingual does them a disservice. Even if no adults in their life know another language, there are still options. Children’s tv shows are available in many languages, so while parents and teachers speak to the child in their native language, the child could watch all of their television in a foreign language.</p>
                  <h3 id="language-learning-in-school">Language Learning in School</h3>
                  <p>Bilingual education in schools involves teaching a secondary language in school alongside of the students’ native language. Students in a bilingual education program would attend multiple classes in each language. For example, basic elementary school English classes would be taught to students, and a similar curriculum in a foreign language would also be taught to students. Core classes and electives would be divided evenly between both languages.</p>
                  <p>To help develop language skills in a social context, children would be encouraged to socialize in the foreign language at school, and their native language at home. This approach to K-12 education would immerse children in diverse language environments from an early age, when their brains have high plasticity. Once a person has learned one additional language, it becomes easier to pick up on others, so a bilingual education system would set students up for a lifetime of beneficial language development!</p>
                  <h3 id="interpersonal-language-learning">Interpersonal Language Learning</h3>
                  <p>In addition to bilingual coursework, foreign languages can be promoted to students through pen pal programs. These programs would work by connecting schools (or school districts) from various countries, and then pairing students from each country one-on-one based on interests. Each student would send messages using their foreign language, and their pen-pals would respond to continue the conversation, and correct any blatant mistakes made by the other pen-pal.  For example, if my pen pal was a French student, I would write messages in French, and I would receive messages written in English.</p>
                  <p>In the past, pen-pal programs have been hard to keep up with, due to the delay of physically mailing letters internationally. However, in today’s age of abundant technology, international correspondence could be done over email or messaging apps, making pen-pals more relatable and accessible for young students. To practice verbal skills, pen-pals could even video-chat eachother.</p>

                  <p><strong>Visual Representation of the Diversity of Languages around the World</strong></p>
                  <p>Think back to your imaginary trip to a foreign country, and picture a more positive situation. You are sitting in a café, asking your waiter about the area, and learning more about the daily life of people in the area. You feel as though you have unlocked a new part of the world, because you can now communicate with locals around the country. This feeling is achievable, especially for young children. It is important to start bilingual education programs now, so we don’t continue depriving future generations of the incredible gift of bilingualism. And as for you? Why are you even still reading this? Get to work on learning that new language, and begin the newest chapter of enriching your life.</p>
