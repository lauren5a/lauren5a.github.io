										<h2>Have you ever wanted to change your major? More than once? Here is a solution.</h2>
									</header>
                  <p><strong>“I have no idea what I want to do”.</strong></p>
                  <p>Unless you are one of the lucky few who discovered their passion during childhood, this thought has likely crossed your mind at least once during your college career. For me, it has been an almost daily occurrence, leading to 3 changes of major, and 3+ considered minors. The world holds so many exciting and intriguing subject areas, making it hard to choose one focused area of study.</p>
                  <p>To me, choosing a major always felt like abandoning the rest of my interests by selecting the one and only subject I am allowed to focus on <em>for the rest of my life</em>. During my process of self discovery, as I was trying to find the subject area I wanted to pursue, I dreamed of a different system. This system would look a lot like today’s system, with one important change: There would be an option for a multidisciplinary major. I’m not sure how practical this system would truly be, but let’s explore it a little bit further anyways.</p>
                  <h3 id="heres-how-it-would-work">Here's how it would work:</h3>
                  <p>Minors are a good way to gain expertise in one area, while still leaving room in your schedule (and your mind) for other subjects. Because of my varied interests, I have always wanted the option to pursue a bunch of minors, without selecting an official major. With minors taking up about 18-30 credits, students with the multidisciplinary major could complete around 5 minors, and then graduate with their degree. If the minors are selected well, they could spread a wide range of subjects, while still working well together and translating into a successful career. This option would allow students to extensively explore the breadth of their interests, and discover innovative ways to combine their interests into real world applications.</p>
                  <p>In practice, the multidisciplinary major may not work out, especially if the student cannot find a way to combine their minors into a career field. This would leave students without an in-depth education in any one area, meaning they may have to go back to school to specialize further.</p>
                  <p><strong>If you are feeling discouraged by the lack of a multidisciplinary major, and don’t know how to approach the <em>major</em> decision that is, well, deciding your major, here is a strategy you can follow:</strong></p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li>Remember: <strong>Your career is about more than just your education</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li>There are so many factors that go into a fulfilling career, and what you have learned in school is only a small piece of that</li>
                  </ul>

                  </figure></li>
                  <li><strong>Decide a few interests</strong> that would allow for a good course of study
                  <ul>
                  <li>This may seem like a daunting task, but it can help to look at the required courses for a major through senior year to see if the major will interest you long-term</li>
                  <li>If you have no idea which interests to explore, taking a free personality quiz such as the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">16 Personalities test</a> in order to discover which careers may fit your personality the best can be a good place to start</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>Take your shortlist of interests, and <strong>narrow it down</strong> to find your major
                  <ul>
                  <li>Signing up for introductory classes from a few majors you are considering and taking a semester to decide what would be best can help you gauge whether you would enjoy a major in practice</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>Once you have made your decision, make a solid effort to <strong>keep up with other interests</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Set specific time in your schedule each week to explore subjects unrelated to schoolwork, whether that be learning a language, taking a pottery class, or reading about physics theories</li>
                  <li>Consider adding a second major, or a minor (or two) if you feel like you could benefit from a formal education in any of your interest areas</li>
                  <li>Stay curious! Don’t be afraid to pick up new interests along the way</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li><p>After you have fallen into a routine with your specialized major and multidisciplinary personal life, don’t be afraid to <strong>make a change</strong>! If you don’t absolutely love what you have chosen to do, refer back to step 1, because you deserve nothing less than to love what you fill your time with.</p></li>
